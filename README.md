# New Covid-19_model

![equations](https://github.com/rosasalberto/Covid-19_model/blob/master/images/equations.PNG)

> Based on the SIR model, but with additions of:
>  
>  - Delays
>  - Deaths 
>  - Variable transmission rate, dependent from government action U
> 
> State Variables:
> 
>  - S = Subsceptible
>  - I = Infective
>  - R = Removed
>  - D = Death
>  - Pd = Probability of death
>  - Tr = Transmision rate
> 
> constant parameters:
>    
>
>  - a = number of days for the infected to show sintoms
>  - b = number of days for the infected to begin infecting
>  - maxtr = maximum tr, normally before quarantine
>  - mintr = minimum tr, normally when severe quarantine
>  - rr = recovery rate
>  - maxdr = maximum death rate, normally when sanitary system are collapsed
>  - mindr = minimum death rate, normally when the sanitary system is not collapsed.
>  - Icol = Infected rate to collapse the sanitary system.
>  - inf_test = rate of tested from infected.
